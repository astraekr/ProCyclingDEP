I thought it could be good to document my thoughts and process here, in the repository, as a mini-blog. This is attempt number 1, let's see how it goes.

So far this has been a fair bit more successful than previous attempts at 'at home' software projects, in that this is the third time I've come back to work at this one. That, for me, is pretty exciting!

## Intentions for tonight
- pull raw html from the site, save it somewhere
- make an effort at making the code handle exceptions nicely
- wrap some code in some unit tests
  - I'd like to try asking chat-gpt to write a unit test for a function

## Thoughts while working
- There are 18,000 riders on the procyclingstats website: I don't want to pull them all. I'll focus on WorldTour (UCI WorldTeams).
